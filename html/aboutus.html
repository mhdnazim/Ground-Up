                    client benefits greatly from the cohesion between their Non ordinary experience and
                    Psychotherapeutic approach,
                    furthering both the depth of Non ordinary experience and breadth of integration.

                <p>To oversimplify, Top down processing sounds like “research suggests 8 glasses of water a day are
                    important” bottom up
                    processing sounds like “I feel thirsty, I am going to get a glass of water” The latter is the
                    expression of an
                    internally lived and organismic regulated truth, these kinds of truths match the phenomenological
                    truths which emerge in
                    Non ordinary states and is why bottom up processing is so important to support.</p>
